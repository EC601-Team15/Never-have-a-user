# Club Helper
Hi, the names of developers are Shuwei Li and Yumeng pan. This project is actually an assignment of EC601 of Boston University. It will be used to analyze the sentiment content of the target users, in order to obtain the feedback of customers and improve the service of providers. Our current idea is to analyze the Tweets of fans of a specific football club, in order to help the club review their decisions, strategy and service.

# Target Users
Our target users are football clubs. If possible, our target users can extend to other types of service providers, such as basketball club, restaurants, etc. However, we will only focus on football clubs right now. We will use Juventus, an Italian football club, as an example. This club has made a few aggressive strategies recently, which is very controversial.

# User Story
In the era of social media, the amount of the fans of a football club can make a difference. The tickets sales and media rights, the sponsorship and advertising, the sales of products and licenses are defined greatly by the quantity of fans. In order to create more revenue, as a manager of Juventus, a modern football club, I need to keep the current fans and make attempts to attract more. As a result, I must analyze fans’ reactions towards the service the club provides and the decision we make. The club can be beneficial from analyzing several aspects of the club:

First, the effects of transfer windows.  We signed a series of famous players last summer, including Cristiano Ronaldo, which costs a huge amount of money. Is it worth? How many fans will follow the players to the new club? How do the current fans react to the arrival of new players? Besides the positive effect, I should also be aware of the effects of the departures of some players. Fans could have negative emotions towards these events and thus unfollow the club.

Second, the experience of the service provided by the stadium.  As an international club, many fans take a long trip and spend a lot of money to watch a game. Are they served with respect? Are they satisfied with the experience they have? It can decide if they will come again or recommend it to others. These feedbacks can also be found on Twitter. I need to obtain the ratio of the negative comments and conclude the aspects need to be improved.

Third, fans’ satisfaction of matches. After a loss, how do they react on the Internet? Do they like the performance of the team or a specific player? Besides, Juventus decided to change the schedule of match time from evening to afternoon, in order to attract more Asian fans. Does the decision attract more Asian fans? However, the local fans’ reactions are also important. Do they feel being ignored? I have to know the public opinions to review our decisions.
